1. remove punctuation and lowercase all characters in the string (ex: "Hello world!" --> "hello world")
2. explode paragraph of words into an array (ex: "hello world" --> ["hello","world"])
3. check exploded array for the test word and count how many times it appears (ex: hello, ["hello","world"] --> 1)
